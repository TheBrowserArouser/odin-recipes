        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Watching Howl's Moving Castle is a great time but can quickly become torturous if you are on an empty stomach.
            Seeing such tasty animations of a classic breakfast, eggs and bacon, cooked to perfection by a snarky fire Demon
            can really work up your appetite and inspire you to go whip up your own batch of eggs and bacon!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p>The ingredients needed for this meal seem to be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Fire Demon named Calcifer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p>I'm no anime chef, but I would assume the steps are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set ingredients down on workstation</li>
            <li>Set bacon to cook</li>
            <li>Use bacon grease to grease up the pan</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into pan</li>
            <li>Feed the eggshells and scraps to Calcifer</li>
            <li>Plate once bacon and eggs are cooked</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
